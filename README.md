# Small Python Projects
In this Repository I'll upload some of my small Python Projects. 

* Auto Versioning Compiling:
Automated program that compiles a python script into an exe with auto versioning.

* MySQLDatabases:
A test to connect to a MySQL database using python.

* Proxy:
I tried to write a proxy in python with the use of some modules. With it, you could edit the code that gets sended to the users browser.

* Site Connectivity Checker:
I tried to write a connectivity checker for websites. It uses the ICMP 4 protocol. You can even show the route to a tested site.


I started this Repository to learn some new Python modules, so here is an overview about the modules I used:

* HTTP Proxy:
  * HTTP.Server
* MySQL Database:
  * MySQL.connector
* Site Connectivity:
  * ICMPlib
* Auto Versioning & Compiling:
  * Pyinstaller
  * OS
  * Packaging.Version
  * shutil
* Corona Cases Desktop Notifications
  * datetime
  * date
  * requests
  * os
  * plyer.notifiaction
